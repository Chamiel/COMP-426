		In Pokemon Go, Raikou has descended onto North America for the period of one month, from August 31 to September 30.
		With a strong moveset coupled with its singular weakness to ground type moves, Raikou is a tough boss, with only one
		optimal counter. The best attacker to face Raikou with is Rhydon, which has the best combination of ground type moves
		along with a rock/ground typing for double resistance against Raikou's electric attacks, allowing Rhydon to survive
		the longest as well. Following Rhydon, the next best attackers consist of other ground type attackers as well as high
		dps neutral attackers.</p>
